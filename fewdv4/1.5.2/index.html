      <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        I have donned many hats over the years, but none have been more rewarding than that of a <strong>software engineer</strong>.  Each day provides a new <strong>opportunity</strong> to solve a complex problem, improve upon a process, and create new, <strong>innovative tools</strong>.  It is a unique feeling to see a product that I contributed to being used "in the wild."
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently work for a major telecommunications company as a Senior Software Engineer.  The primary application that I work on is built with AngularJS and Codeigniter.
      </p>

      <p>
        My driving force is my family, I have a loving, understanding, and beautiful wife and two amazingly wonderful daughters that remind me every day of the reason that I go to work.  I believe that it is important to maintain a health work/life balance, and strive to do so.

      <h1 class="heading">Where I'm From</h2>

      <p>
        I'm born and raised in Central New York.  No no, not New York City!  Go north about 4 hours north and you'll hit Syracuse.  I'm just a hair north on the left side of Oneida lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        I earned my Bachelors degree from Colorado Technical University in Computer Science, concentrating on <strong>web development</strong>.
