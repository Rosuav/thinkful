          <p>
            I have donned many hats over the years, but none have been more rewarding than that of a software engineer. Each day provides a new opportunity to solve a complex problem, improve upon a process, and create new, innovative tools. It is a unique feeling to see a product that I contributed to being used "in the wild."
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently work for a major telecommunications company as a Senior Software Engineer. The primary application that I work on is built with AngularJS and Codeigniter.
          </p>

          <p>
            My driving force is my family, I have a loving, understanding, and beautiful wife and two amazingly wonderful daughters that remind me every day of the reason that I go to work. I believe that it is important to maintain a health work/life balance, and strive to do so.

          <p>
            I'm born and raised in Central New York. No no, not New York City! Go north about 4 hours north and you'll hit Syracuse. I'm just a hair north on the left side of Oneida lake.

          <p>
            I earned my Bachelors degree from Colorado Technical University in Computer Science, concentrating on web development.

                I first got interested in developing back in high school, trying to impress a girl.  I've been hooked ever since.  I've been developing for the web for over 15 years now.  As mentioned above, I earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science to help make the resume more appealing.
